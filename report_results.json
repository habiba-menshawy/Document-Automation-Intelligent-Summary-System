Colby, W. R. Conway,\nR. H. Marshall\n?\nSUMMARY\n2\nThe paper recons from Marlboro KS and Marlboro Menthol Lights loo's\nwere found to be different. The paper recon from Marlboro KS\ncontained DAP and therefore exhibited the sugar-armonia products. The\nMarlboro Menthol Lights loo's paper recon did not contain phosphate in\nexcess of the level typically found in PJS where no DAP was added.\nTherefore, the levels of the sugar-anmonia prggucts were much lower\n(80-8s%) in the paper recon from Marlboro Menthol Lights 1oo's.\nIt has not been proven, but the furnish for the two paper recon are\nalso thought to be different. The furnish for the paper recon found\nin Marlboro KS was thought to be heavily skewed toward burley while,\nthe furnish for the Marlboro Menthol Ligbts loo's was thought to be\nskewed toward flue-cured furnish.\nA comparison of the paper and dark recons from Marlboro Ks were also\nmade. This comparison showed that paper recon exhibited most of the\nsugar-ammonia reaction products found in the dark recon and in about\nthe same quantities. The major differences were found in the welatile\nalkyl pyrazines region of the PaT profiles.\nINTRODUCTION\n2\nBob Jobnson bad isolated the paper recon from Marlboro KS and Mariboro\nMenthol Ligbts loo's. These materials, along with the dark recon from\nMarlboro KS, were eramined by purge-and-trap (PaT) and direct\nR\nsilylation (DS) GC-Ms. The combination of both of these analyues\nshoved the volatiles from the alkylpyrazines to deoxyfructosazine and\nfructosaziues. Data from both of the analyses were ueed to reach the\ns\nconclusions drawm in this file note.\n*\n812 76066",
